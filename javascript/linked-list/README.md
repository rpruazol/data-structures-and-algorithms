# Linked List Implementation

## Summary, Description, Approach & Efficiency, Solution
- Create a Linked List class
- Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
- Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
- The class should contain the following methods
  - ```
    insert
    Arguments: value
    Returns: nothing
    Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  - ```
    includes
    Arguments: value
    Returns: Boolean
    Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
  - ```
    to string
    Arguments: none
    Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
    "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
